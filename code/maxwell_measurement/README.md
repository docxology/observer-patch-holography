# Serial Maxwell measurement adapter

This package prepares and checks captures of one fixed Maxwell **emulator**.
Its bounded observer-like patches have 42 local potential registers, ports,
baseline and response records, destructive pair-average probes, and feedback
that restores the measured registers. Two gauge executions each contain three
slices, 60 probes per slice, 180 feedback cycles and 585 semantic events.

No apparatus, physical raw data, frozen experiment or observed result is shipped.
The adapter does not identify encoded values with electromagnetic fields in
nature. It does not close a physical realization or calibration obligation.

## Draft and freeze

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 code/maxwell_measurement/contract.py --output /tmp/maxwell-preregistration.json
```

The command writes a `DRAFT`, refuses to overwrite an existing contract, and
prints its hash. It pins the adapter producer, verifier and adversarial tests;
a changed implementation invalidates a frozen contract. Supply an actual
study/run identity, device/firmware identity,
capture kind, calibration references, signed gain and offset intervals, raw
uncertainty, and a separately calibrated hardware clock. The 42 oriented channel
maps must describe the apparatus. Negative gain requires negative orientation;
an edge channel then reverses its physical endpoint order. Raw units are `V`
or `raw_count`, and transformed quantities are dimensionless model potentials.

Each channel calibration contains at least two distinct external reference
samples, recorded before the freeze. A reference has `id`, `raw`, `model_value`,
`captured_utc` and `source: "external_reference"`. Its reference-certificate hash
is retained. No episode sample, including the held-out third slice, may enter
calibration. A hardware operator must inspect the actual references; declaring
their hashes is not a verification of a calibration laboratory.

The supplied design ceilings bound coordinate uncertainty by `1/1000`, field
uncertainty by `1/20`, and field/source-action uncertainty by `1/2` in the
declared model units. They may be tightened. Disabled-feedback controls must
resolve at least `1/4` of model potential. These are acceptance-design choices,
not measured device specifications. Freeze the completed file before capture,
retain its bytes externally, and pass its digest separately to the verifier.
Changing a threshold after capture requires a new experiment.

## Raw capture interface

The closed capture schema is `oph.maxwell_measurement.capture.v1`. Its fields
are `study_id`, `run_id`, `capture_kind`, `device_id`, `firmware_sha256`,
`captured_utc`, `controls`, and `executions`, in addition to `schema`.
UTC timestamps use ISO spelling ending in `Z`. Every numerical measurement,
interval endpoint and raw device timestamp is a canonical rational string,
such as `"-3/2"`; JSON floats are rejected.

The three ordered controls are `sham_no_probe`, `pair_mean`, and
`feedback_disabled`. Each has `name`, `start_tick`, `end_tick`, and four
`samples`, whose roles are `before_left`, `before_right`, `after_left`,
`after_right`. Inputs are model potentials `-1/2` and `3/2` on `slot0` and
`slot12`. The sham preserves both values. The mean and disabled-feedback
controls end at `1/2` on both ports. The latter must visibly fail restoration.
This is a calibrated held-out control, not a calibration-independent ratio:
different channel gains do not cancel.

The two executions have `gauge: false` and `gauge: true`, in that order. Each
has 585 `events`. An event has `trace`, `start_tick`, `end_tick`, and `samples`.
Its `trace` uses the serial parent's exact operation/argument/read/writer/write
schema. It must represent actual device consumption. Copying the software
parent is not physical evidence. Every logical read needs the register,
writer identity and consumed value version; claimed parents cannot invent
reads. An independent witness must bind this trace to the apparatus capture.

Every sample has exactly `role`, `channel`, `raw`, `tick`, and a unique `nonce`.
Samples occur strictly inside their event windows, in the order below; event
windows and the preceding controls cannot overlap. Clock uncertainty enters
these inequalities. The required roles are:

| Operation | Samples, in order |
| --- | --- |
| `seed`, `advance` | `loaded_0` through `loaded_41` |
| `baseline` | `input`, `retained_baseline` |
| `probe` | `before_left`, `before_right`, `after_left`, `after_right` |
| `response` | `response`, `retained_response` |
| `feedback` | `restored_left`, `restored_right` |
| `decode` | `decoded_0` through `decoded_41` |
| Other operations | Empty sample array; full trace retained |

`slot0` through `slot11` encode node potentials; `slot12` through `slot41`
encode the thirty canonically oriented edge potentials. Baseline and response
records use their parent-node channel's transfer. Capture adapters must measure
those retained records under that transfer, or declare an apparatus where this
encoding is actually implemented. Channel assignments cannot be inferred from
captured values. The complete population has 3,540 raw samples.

The verifier reconstructs potentials from the raw baselines/responses using
`A = 2 response - baseline`. It checks the independently captured public decode,
both endpoint reconstructions, held-out slice 2, Maxwell residuals and the
field/source action. Exact rational interval arithmetic propagates calibration,
offset and raw-error bounds into `E = -2 ΔA - D phi` and `B = C A`, followed by
the action. The immutable parent supplies the action step `h = 1/2` and charged
paths. The verifier freshly executes its independent proof on every call.
These currents are declared source registers, not independently measured
physical matter currents. Agreement of a submitted trace with the parent
cannot by itself attest that hardware consumed those values; that separate
fact is part of the externally witnessed scope.

Clock calibration interval width may be at most `1/1000` of its positive lower
endpoint. Physical-device decode durations are reported in seconds under the declared
clock calibration. They are not identified with the model action parameter,
the feedback count, a Lorentz clock or signal travel time. No common-clock or
physical spacetime claim follows from monotone captures.

## Verification and external trust

```sh
python3 code/maxwell_measurement/verify.py \
  --preregistration /path/to/frozen-preregistration.json \
  --capture /path/to/capture.json \
  --preregistration-sha256 OPERATOR_RETAINED_PREREGISTRATION_HASH \
  --capture-sha256 OPERATOR_RETAINED_CAPTURE_HASH
```

Synthetic captures return `SYNTHETIC_CONFORMANCE_ONLY`. Hardware captures
without external attestation return `CAPTURE_CONFORMS_UNATTESTED` with exit
code 1. Malformed or nonconforming captures return `INVALID` with exit code 2.

For independently witnessed data, also supply `--operator-attestation` and
`--operator-attestation-sha256`. The operator retains this hash independently
of the claimant. The closed `oph.maxwell_measurement.operator_attestation.v1`
packet names the same study/run, device/firmware, preregistration/capture hashes
and UTC dates. It also names a distinct `operator_identity` and
`independent_witness_identity`; either may name a person or an organization.
It does not require three institutions. Its `scope` must explicitly attest
all these predicates:

- `physical_device_and_raw_capture_witnessed`
- `actual_read_write_consumption_witnessed`
- `complete_run_and_control_population`
- `firmware_and_device_identity_checked`
- `calibration_references_checked`
- `calibration_independent_of_episode_and_heldout_data`
- `preregistration_precedes_capture`
- `clock_reference_and_capture_timestamps_checked`

The result then says `CAPTURE_CONFORMS_RELATIVE_TO_OPERATOR_ATTESTATION`.
This is conditional on the operator's externally chosen trust declarations;
the adapter does not authenticate an organization, verify a witness signature,
or detect a coalition that supplies false external attestations. It never
certifies physical truth or a complete physical episode. The existing class-H
hardware evidence verifier remains a separate, unchanged policy boundary.
A synthetic capture is ineligible for attestation even if a trust file is
supplied. No automatic change is made to an instrument or observation ledger.

## Controls

```sh
python3 -m pytest -q code/maxwell_measurement/test_measurement.py
```

Tests create explicitly synthetic captures in temporary directories. They
exercise signed transfers, exact interval field/action reconstruction, strict
schemas and fresh parent replay. Coherently rehashed mutations cover omitted
channels/events/probes, changed held-out coordinates, forged writers/parents,
extra synthetic reads, missing feedback, wrong current, calibration leakage,
uncertainty inflation, clock substitution, nonce reuse and capture reordering.
No synthetic capture is committed as a physical run or valid observed receipt.

## Lean 4.35 parent custody migration

The original emulator parent `2ec7dbf29f700b420def821f1a69c1f8087428e78f77f8a818bf7483482e73a2` is retained in Git
commit `bfa6c44d5347f113a5418d2a25d836f1057993a2`. The first actual replay changed only
Lean source identities and produced the intermediate digest
`18bfd8565e05ae571b0edac9626fb30244edd4d732cb30707d753672e1a36987`. That intermediate is retained as a run preimage,
not claimed as an immutable Git epoch. A second independent replay bound the
qualified Maxwell producer source and produced the current parent
`ed20c921d8e03b73acd85a24c9a3abc76f29c642c51dbee53642704a86134f6d`. The complete exact emulator executions, assumptions
and scope remain unchanged in both steps. The adjacent migration record
separates their source identities and evidence. Frozen study and capture
bytes remain unchanged. A changed adapter requires a new reviewed freeze
for future capture; these software replays supply no physical measurement
or calibration evidence.
